### What I learned

Had to start this project from scratch after I was not happy with the results. It looked way better after that. The conclusion every time is that I complicate things with some wrong design decisions I later need to remove, which confuses me in the layout building process. Next time I will spend more time studying the differences between mobile and desktop version to have a clear goal in how I want to solve the challenge.

### Continued development

Focus on proper use of spacing, as I feel like this layout can be even sleeker. Also will add an upgraded button design with 'shadows' and animations in the future.
